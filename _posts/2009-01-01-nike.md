description: Nike Face Tuned was made for the 20 years anniversary of the Nike TN. We teamed up with the studio <a href="https://www.dvtk.us/" target="_blank">DVTK</a> and the 3D artist<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ines.alpha/" target="_blank"> Ines Alpha</a> to make an augmented reality iPad app using Face ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/Xdu7EpzWDos?t=341" target="_blank">Guests at the event</a> could record videos and send them by mail from the app. It was made with Unity, and uses Face ID from ARKit.
