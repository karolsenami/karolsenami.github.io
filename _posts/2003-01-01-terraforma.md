description: Terraforma is an interactive experimental web-documentary. Taking place in a post-apocalyptical future, the focus was to educate about environmental issues. We used Vue.js for the display, and Three.js for the 3D. My first real web project, that made me learn a lot, about design, web development and 3D.
