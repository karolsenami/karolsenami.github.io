description: An interactive installation for Ruinart we did at Digitas Labs. I made the software (openFrameworks) that uses a Kinect to detect people, and the wiring to connect the software to an Arduino. We installed it in Cannes, were it successfully ran on its own for 1 week. I also did a home-made software for us to create and edit strips animations.
