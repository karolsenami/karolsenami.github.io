description: After 2 years of good duty, it was time to refresh the Digitas Labs portfolio. The Labs team gave me the opportunity to train my graphic skills by doing the portfolio from (almost) zero, because we like doing things on our own ! It was coded in Jekyll, a light framework I felt in love with (my portfolio is in Jekyll too).
